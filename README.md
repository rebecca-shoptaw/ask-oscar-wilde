## Background & Mission

The idea behind Ask Oscar Wilde was twofold: first, to bring back some of the fun, simple, carefree energy of the minigames of the early internet -- something I'm trying to do in a number of my projects -- and second, to bring the delightful work of Oscar Wilde to new audiences in a fun and surprising manner.

## UI Walkthrough

The current version of the UI is very straightforward -- the user sees an empty autofocused input box where they are encouraged to enter a predicament, and when they click "Submit", a random Oscar Wilde quote is generated as a response.

If the user hits submit again, they will see a fresh quote, but if they try to hit submit without entering a predicament, Oscar will ask "Why won't you tell me what's troubling you??"

If they select "New Predicament", the input will clear, and Oscar will ask what else he can help with.

## Implementation

The implementation is quite straightforward as well -- just about everything happens within the `AskOscar` component, and relies on two simple functions -- `newQuote` and `clearInput` -- and two state values, one to store the user input and one to store the current Ocar Wilde quote.

The `newQuote` function, which fires when the user hits "Submit," checks to determine that there is a user input, then selects a random quote from the `oscarQuotes` array, stored separately:

```
const newQuote = () =>
    input == ""
      ? setQuote("Why won't you tell me what ails you??")
      : setQuote(oscarQuotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * oscarQuotes.length)]);
```

The `clearInput` function, which fires when the user hits "New Predicament," resets the user input and Oscar quote, and refocuses on the input using a `useRef` hook:

```
 const clearInput = () => {
    setInput("");
    setQuote("With what else may I assist you?");
    inputRef.current?.focus();
  };
```

## Next Steps

- [x] Redo styling using SASS
- [ ] Replace remaining Boostrap classes with SASS code
- [ ] Use GSAP to create a fun quote loading and reveal animation
- [ ] Add a test suite via Jest
